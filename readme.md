# Basic RTOS Task Scheduler in Embedded C

## Overview
A simple round-robin task scheduler in Embedded C, simulating RTOS task management. Includes two tasks: LED blink and data logging. Inspired by my MediaTek internship, where I debugged throughput and call drop issues in 5G protocols.

## Features
- Task creation and scheduling with configurable periods
- Simulated tick-based execution
- Debug logs for throughput monitoring, reflecting MediaTek experience

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Compile with any C compiler (e.g., gcc, Keil)
3. Run to see task execution logs

## Relevance
Demonstrates Embedded C and RTOS skills for automotive/comm systems at companies like Bosch or Continental.
